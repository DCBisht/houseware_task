# React Todo App Test Plan

## Introduction
This document outlines the testing strategy for the Todo React App using Cypress. Cypress is a modern end-to-end testing framework for web applications. The goal is to ensure that all components and features of the Todo App are thoroughly tested to maintain quality and functionality.

## Test Structure
Tests will be organized into test suites corresponding to the different components and functionalities of the Todo App. Each test suite will contain multiple test cases covering various scenarios.


## Running React App and Tests

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn cypress`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
